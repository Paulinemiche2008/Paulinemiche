I want to be a successful lawyer someday or a psychologist. I am actually shy infront pf other people but very outgoing infront of my friends,
I have a bubbly personality. Im so obsessed with color purple, i love singing alone in my room but shy outside. I love going to church and worshipping our almighty God, he is my strength in all ways. Im also a type of person who loves to explore and discover stuffs that's unfamiliar to me,
I want to step out of my comfort zone. I love being alone, im at
peace with myself. I want to travel around the world. addition to that i love the nature
Music
and eating so.. that's basically me.
